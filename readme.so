Overview
A full-stack application that predicts the likelihood of heart disease using a clinically recognized 13-feature dataset, pairing a performant ML model with an accessible web interface. The project includes model training, evaluation, export, and a UI-driven prediction flow designed for clarity and educational insight. The goal is to provide an end-to-end reference from data to deployment for a real-world health ML predictor.

Features
End-to-end pipeline: data prep → model training → evaluation → export → web inference → deployment.

13-attribute input flow aligned to the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset format.

Interpretable metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix) and configurable model selection.

Web app deployed at heart-disease-predictor-sandy.vercel.app with a JavaScript-heavy frontend.

Mixed stack: JavaScript (~62%), Python (~34%), HTML (~4%).

Architecture
Frontend: JavaScript UI for stepwise inputs, validation, and result display.

Model Service: Python scripts for training and inference (e.g., scikit-learn), exporting a serialized model artifact.

Model Artifact: Saved via joblib/pickle and loaded at runtime by the inference endpoint.

Deployment: Vercel for frontend hosting; backend can be serverless function or external microservice depending on setup.

Tech Stack
JavaScript/HTML for UI and integration.

Python for training and inference (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, joblib).

Vercel for deployment/orchestration.

Dataset
Source: Cleveland Heart Disease dataset (13 features, 303 samples).

Implementation Steps
Problem framing

Define binary prediction with 13 features and class balance handling.

Set evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, ROC-AUC.

Data ingestion and validation

Load CSV; validate dtypes, ranges, missing values.

Encode categorical fields (cp, restecg, slope, thal) and treat ca/thal as categorical/ordinal as appropriate.

Preprocessing and pipeline

Apply StandardScaler for numeric features; OneHotEncoder for categoricals.

Use scikit-learn Pipeline/ColumnTransformer to bind preprocessing and estimator.

Model selection

Baselines: LogisticRegression (liblinear/saga), RandomForest, SVM, GradientBoosting.

Cross-validate with StratifiedKFold; tune via GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluation

Hold-out test set; compute confusion matrix, classification report, ROC-AUC.

Save artifacts: model.joblib, metrics.json, params.json, scaler/encoder within pipeline.

Serialization

Export entire pipeline to joblib for consistent transforms at inference.

Inference API

Implement POST /predict expecting JSON feature payload; validate schema.

Return prediction, probability, and echo inputs; optionally include SHAP for explanation.

Frontend UX

13-step wizard with tooltips and validation; map labels to codes.

Display result with risk label and probability; provide guidance text.

Deployment

Deploy frontend to Vercel; configure API routes or external service URL.

Add environment variables through Vercel dashboard; enable preview deployments.

Monitoring and maintenance

Log requests, inputs, and outputs with privacy controls; track error rates.

Add versioning to model artifacts and a simple model registry directory.

Save metrics and confusion matrix.

Frontend Notes
Use a form schema that enforces valid numeric ranges and categorical codes.

Provide mapping UI for cp, slope, restecg, thal; persist draft input between steps.

Handle network errors and timeouts; show loading states.

Deployment
Vercel: configure build command and output directory for frontend; set API routes under /api if using serverless.

If Python backend is separate: deploy to Render/Fly.io/railway.app and reference URL in frontend env.

Add CORS configuration for cross-origin requests.

Reproducing Results
Seed runs with --seed to ensure deterministic splits.

Log model summary, class weights if used, and selected features.

Validate that prediction on a canonical sample matches expected value after export/load.

Security and Privacy
Client-side validation plus server-side schema enforcement.

Avoid storing PII; treat sample inputs as non-identifying.

Rate-limit API to prevent abuse; monitor for drift before clinical claims.

Roadmap
Add SHAP-based explanations and feature importance UI.

Confidence calibration (Platt scaling/Isotonic).

Multi-model A/B testing with canary deployment.

Accessibility improvements and localization.

Contributing
Fork and create a feature branch; ensure lint/tests pass.

Submit PRs with clear description and before/after metrics.

License
Add an OSS license (e.g., MIT/Apache-2.0) at project root.

Notes and assumptions

This README is crafted from the repository metadata and typical patterns for Heart Disease Predictor projects with JS/Python/Vercel; paths and commands should be aligned to the actual code structure in the repository.

If the repository includes a distinct framework (Next.js, Flask/FastAPI, etc.), replace commands and folder names accordingly.

How It Works
Problem framing

Binary classification to estimate heart disease risk given 13 clinical inputs.

Metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC; confusion matrix for diagnostic insight.

Data handling

Load CSV; check dtypes, handle missing values, and validate ranges.

Encode categoricals (cp, restecg, slope, thal) and ensure consistent treatment of ca/thal values.

Preprocessing pipeline

Numeric features → StandardScaler; categorical features → OneHotEncoder.

Use ColumnTransformer + Pipeline so the exact transforms are bundled with the model.

Model selection and tuning

Start with LogisticRegression; explore RandomForest, SVM, GradientBoosting.

StratifiedKFold cross-validation; hyperparameters via GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV.

Evaluation and persistence

Hold-out test set; log metrics, confusion matrix, and ROC curve stats.

Save model.joblib plus metrics.json and params.json for traceability.

Inference service

POST /predict accepts validated JSON payload, loads model.joblib, returns class and probability.

Optional SHAP explanations for local interpretability.

Frontend UX

Stepwise form or single-page form with tooltips and validation for all 13 inputs.

Results page shows prediction, confidence, and advisory text about clinical use limits.

Deployment

Frontend on Vercel; API as Vercel serverless or hosted Python app with CORS enabled.

Environment variables configured in Vercel dashboard or service provider.
